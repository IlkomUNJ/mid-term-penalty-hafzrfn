During the segmentation analysis, I stayed with using the 3x3 boolean matrix because compared to other variations like the 5x3, 4x3 or even 5x5, it has the most efficient performance. Source is found through gemini AI and we will go with that 

for Objective 2 in order to report all fitting of approparite window pattern of 3x3 segments I plan to make a program to output all the non-empty windows into the terminal which will be discussed in Objective 3 answer 

The algorithm I created I sought assistance with gemini AI (perplexity is currently down) and developed the algorithm to output all non-empty windows in the terminal, as well as modifying the paintevent function to draw the purple symbols to mark the candidates
